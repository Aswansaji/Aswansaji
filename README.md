# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hi<br>

My name is ASWAN SAJEEV
Electrical & Electronics Engineering Student | AI, Drone Technology & Embedded Systems Enthusiast
<br>

I am an Electrical & Electronics Engineering student at NIT Andhra Pradesh, with a strong interest in embedded systems, automation, and electric vehicles. My journey began with fundamental electronics and microcontroller-based projects, gradually expanding into advanced domains such as power systems, control systems, AI-driven automation, and real-time embedded development.

I actively work on projects using Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi, STM32, and ESP32, integrating sensors, communication modules, and AI techniques to develop practical engineering solutions. I am also currently working on an AI-based circuit designing model that helps users generate optimized circuit concepts based on their requirements.

I enjoy exploring emerging technologies, designing efficient circuits, and building systems that seamlessly connect hardware with intelligent software.
